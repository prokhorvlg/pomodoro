# pomodoro
pomodoro is a demo for a React-based pomodoro-styled timer web app. It is hosted at https://prokhorvlg.github.io/pomodoro/.

Created by [prokhorvlg (Valentin Sigalov)](https://github.com/prokhorvlg).

## Technologies

* **React** (JavaScript framework, React hooks, functional components)
* **SCSS** (Styling)
* **Font Awesome** (All icons were added using font awesome, including the site icon)

## Features

* Use a **pomodoro timer** to make the most out of your workflow (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break, 25 minutes long break at the end)
* **Plays a notification sound/changes tab title** to notify the user even if they are not in the tab
* **Skip to the next session** if you have finished your session early
* **Modify the number of sets** (pomodoro-break pairs) on the fly
* **Responsive** and usable on mobile

## How to Set Up and Run

1. Open terminal on the folder you want to use the project from.
2. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/prokhorvlg/pomodoro.git`.
3. Run `npm install` to install packages.
4. Run `npm start` to start the app.
5. Visit `localhost:3000` if the app does not automatically open in browser.

## How to Deploy (GitHub Pages)

Assuming the project is cloned, use `npm run deploy` to deploy latest version of project to GitHub Pages.

## Future ideas
* Add *unit testing*! I would have done so if I had more time to spare.
* Add a *settings screen* to permit the user to modify the time spans for sessions.
* Perhaps add a *visual indicator* (such as a row of colored circles at the top) to give the user a better picture of what the complete pomodoro work session looks like.
